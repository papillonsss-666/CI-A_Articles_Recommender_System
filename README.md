# CI-A_Articles_Recommender_System
Deskdrop is an internal communications platform developed by CI&T, focused in companies using Google G Suite. Among other features, this platform allows companies employees to share relevant articles with their peers, and collaborate around them.

This project has three goals:
1. Explore the dataset and draw insights of the datasets.
2. Perform topic modeling to find out the main topics of the article dataset.
3. Establish a recommender system that recommends articles to the users using popularity model, collaborative filtering, content-based filtering and hybrid method.
